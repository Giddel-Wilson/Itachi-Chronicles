                    <p>After the Uchiha Clan Massacre, Itachi Uchiha fled Konohagakure and joined the Akatsuki, a
                        criminal organization that was dedicated to collecting all of the Tailed Beasts
                    </p>
                    <p>There are several reasons why Itachi joined the Akatsuki. First, he believed that the Akatsuki
                        could be used to bring peace to the world. Second, he wanted to keep an eye on the Akatsuki and
                        make sure that they did not pose a threat to Konohagakure. Third, he wanted to protect his
                        younger brother, Sasuke, from the Akatsuki.</p>
                    <p>Itachi's decision to join the Akatsuki was a controversial one. Many people believed that he had
                        betrayed Konohagakure and that he was now a villain. However, Itachi's true intentions were
                        never malicious. He simply wanted to protect the people he loved and to create a better world.
                    </p>
